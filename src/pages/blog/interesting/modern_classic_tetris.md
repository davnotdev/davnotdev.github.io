# Modern Classic Tetris Is Alive, but Has Classic Tetris Died?

TODO VISUAL

Recently, I got my hands on Tetris Effect, and I was facinated.
Not by the visuals, but by Zone Battle and Classic Score Battle, and especially
latter which I had not played in over a year.
I originally began playing classic tetris at its golden year (2019), and a lot
has changed since then in both positive and negative ways (in my opinion of
course) to create what I'll call "Modern" Classic Tetris.

## The Classic Explanation of Classic Tetris

TODO VISUAL

Ripped straight from Wikipedia: "Tetris (or Classic Tetris) is a puzzle video
game for the Nintendo Entertainment System (NES) released in 1989, based on
Tetris (1984) by Alexey Pajitnov."
Classic Tetris is generally seen as a more "pure" form of the game as newer
titles have added features to make the game more accessible.
With just a one piece preview and no hold, pieces snap instantly upon landing.
Unlike its modern counterparts, pieces in Classic Tetris are completely (pseudo)
random meaning that player may go through 80 pieces without finding their
desired piece.
The leveling system is also simple.
Starting at level 18, players must clear 130 lines to transition to level 19
where the speed increases.
Finally, players must work to score as many tetris-es as possible before level
29, the kill screen, where the speed gets so fast, it is **impossible** to survive.
_(Insert foreshadowing here.)_
Where modern derivatives of Tetris are all about pushing the limits of speed
and damage throughput, the restrictive game mechanics of Classic Tetris force
players to juggle risk and rewards while simultaneously praying to not be
rejected by Lady Luck.
This is why people find the game both fascinating and intense.

## The Evolution of Play Styles

Classic Tetris was met with instant success upon release and with that came
waves of fans eagerly dissecting the game mechanics to find the optimal strategy.
Among many techniques (whole BOOKS have been written about Tetris
technique), one quirk of the NES was quickly taken advantage of: Delayed Auto-Shift.

When you hold the `A` key of your keyboard in Google Docs for example, one
letter initially appears on the screen and after about half a second, many new
letters begin to continuously appear.
When you let go and try again, the same happens.
Classic Tetris has this exact feature, but with two quirk.
(1) Rather than resetting when you let go, auto repeat is reset when you press
the controller a second time **EXCEPT** (2) if you press the controller at a
very specific frame window when your piece locks in.
Essentially, what I'm saying is that Classic Tetris players found a way to have
the `A` key auto repeat forever, without having the initial wait time.
This added another aspect for players to juggle, but those who mastered DAS
could seemingly play the game effortless even at high speeds.

A second, more powerful technique was found as well called hyper-tapping.
Now, this technique is very very advanced, requiring knowledge of the game's
internals, reverse-engineered source code, and timings.
Essentially, you press the controller button..., but faster.
Wow.
In the past few years, hyper-tappers have been able to crush DAS records and
even play a bit on the kill screen!
Although this play style is easier to master in theory, it can be straining on
the arm when used for long periods of time.

## So What is "Modern" Classic Tetris Supposed to Mean?

Ok, I've doing all this technique strategy talk, yet I still have not explained
the title.
What is "Modern" Classic Tetris.
You see, there had always been a limit at level 29.
Although players could score a few lines, not even the best hyper-tappers could
play consistently enough to survive.
Well, in 2020, there are a revelation that would completely change the
competitive scene.
A player discovered a technique that had been hidden in plain sight this whole time.
This technique became known as rolling.

By rolling all fingers on the back on the controller, players were able to
achieve speeds that were previously unheard of.
Where the previous score world record was at the time was 1.4 million (obtained
only by a few players), the current world record as of writing is almost 6.5
million performed by EricICX.
To give you an idea of how insane that is, an original, unmodified version of
Classic Tetris can only go up to 1 million, called a maxout.
This was enough at the time, but a mod was released, expanding that to 1.6
million (which would reset back to zero if passed though no one ever got that
far anyway).
Most people considered this patch overkill, but nowadays, impressive scores are
counted in rollovers meaning how many times the score rolls over back to zero
from passing 1.6 million.

When rolling was first discovered, interest in the topic exploded.
Everyone was excited for the new heights this technique would take the game to.
If you ask me, this marks the beginning of "Modern" Classic Tetris.
For once, people stopped asking _if_ some limits were passible but rather _when_
it would happen.
Now, don't get me wrong, I still find rolling extremely fascinating and
impressive, but the rolling technique presents interesting questions and challenges.

For example, last year (2022), people began advocating for a level cap.
If rollers can theoretically play forever, wouldn't that make matches too long?
Wouldn't that be unfair to DAS and hyper-tappers who physically do not have the
capabilities to play forever?
The answer last year in the CTWC (Classic Tetris World Champion) was no, so the
level cap was never implemented.

## The Opinion Bit

However, there is one question I have.
Is _Classic_ Classic Dead?
In other words, will we ever get games as nerve-racking as the ones from
_back in the day_.
Like I mentioned before, the looming threat of the kill screen is one a most
important aspects of Classic Tetris.
Though, that pressure is no longer as strong since the threat of the kill
screen has somewhat been conquered since rollers can always make up for bad play
on the kill screen anyway (well, with or without rolling, playing on the kill
screen still takes immense skill).

Well, my answer to that question is mostly no, but a bit of yes as well.
[Good DAS only matches do still exist](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WJdYhJg1DwE),
and [watching two godlike rollers face off will always make for a good match](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L_l4dj0KRA),
but at the same time, the magic of mainstream matches with DAS and hyper-tapping
players [like this one](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNZsCJkrt8U) (one of my
all time favorites) may never happen again.

Wow, that was a lot to talk about.
Thanks for reading all the way here.
I will always appreciate that you took the time to listen to my nonsense.
For closing thoughts, I'm honestly surprised that I had to use the term "back
in the day" earlier.
I don't think I'm even old enough nor have I played enough Tetris to use that term.
I also hope that the world of Classic Tetris will be able to have both the very
impressive rolling stuff as well as the old fashioned DAS vs DAS matches that I crave.
After all those decades, the fact that Classic Tetris is still growing is
absolutely insane.
