# Cadin

Yes, I wrote this on physical paper.
Sorry if the aspect ratios aren't good and all that.
For context, I was bored during History class, so I decided to create my own
writing system for English called Cadin, inspired by Sitelen Sitelen, Arabic,
and Korean. What you are looking at here is the fourth iteration since the
original design.
