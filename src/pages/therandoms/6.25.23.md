My internet bit the dust yesterday, so just an FYI:

`npx` hangs when running without internet.

It's probably checking for updates (or something) and waiting for a result, so
do yourself a favor and run `npx --offline`.

I couldn't find any information about this `--offline` flag (mainly because I'm
offline right now), and it could very well be a placebo, but hey, it works.
