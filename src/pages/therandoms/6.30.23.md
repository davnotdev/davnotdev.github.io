Are humans deterministic?

In other words, if I raise two physically identical humans and raise them
exactly identical in identical environments, will they behave exactly the same?

Another way to ask the question: can humans truely think randomly?

No, probably not.

There you go, just answered my own question during writing.

(Sorry if I sound like an robot, human.)
